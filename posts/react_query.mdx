## What is React Query ?

React Query is a data-fetching and state management library for React applications. It provides an abstraction over data-fetching, caching, synchronization, and updates, making it easy to fetch, cache, and manage server data in your React application. React Query is built to work with any API or data source, like REST or GraphQL, and helps to eliminate common issues like race conditions and stale data.

## How to use React Query

1. Install React Query :

```bash
npm install react-query
```

2. Import QueryClient and QueryClientProvider from 'react-query'

3. Create a QueryClient instance

4. Wrap your application with QueryClientProvider and pass the queryClient as a prop.

## 1. QueryClientProvider

```javascript
// Import QueryClient and QueryClientProvider
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";

// Create a new QueryClient instance
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  // Wrap our application with the QueryClientProvider
  return (
    // Pass the queryClient instance as a prop
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <YourComponent />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## 2. useQuery

useQuery is a custom hook provided by React Query for fetching, caching, and updating server state in your components.

```javascript
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(queryKey, queryFn, options);
```

### QueryKey:

A QueryKey is a unique identifier for a query. QueryKeys are used to manage data caching based on the key. It can be specified as a string or an array.

```javascript
// as a string
useQuery('todos', ...)
// as an array
useQuery(['todos'], ...)
```

In case the query is dependent on a variable, the variable should also be added to the QueryKey.

```javascript
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(["todos", id], () =>
  axios.get(`http://.../${id}`)
);
```

### Query Functions:

A function that returns a promise that resolves the data you want to fetch.

```javascript
useQuery("todos", fetchTodos);
useQuery(["todos", todoId], () => fetchTodoById(todoId));
useQuery(["todos", todoId], async () => {
  const data = await fetchTodoById(todoId);
  return data;
});
useQuery(["todos", todoId], ({ queryKey }) => fetchTodoById(queryKey[1]));
```

### Query Options:

An optional object with configurations like enabled, retry, onSuccess, etc.

1. enabled (boolean)

- The 'enabled' option prevents queries from running automatically.
- The code below means that the query request will only be executed if 'id' exists.

```javascript
const { data } = useQuery(["todos", id], () => fetchTodoById(id), {
  enabled: !!id,
});
```

2. retry (boolean | number | (failureCount: number, error: TError) => boolean)

- The 'retry' option retries failed queries.
- By default, it retries three times upon a query failure.
- Setting it to 'true' will retry indefinitely on failed queries, and 'false' will not retry at all.

3. staleTime (number | Infinity)

- The 'staleTime' is the duration that the data remains in a fresh state. After this time, the state becomes stale.
- The default staleTime is 0.
- In fresh state, fetch doesn't execute even if the query is mounted again.

4. cacheTime (number | Infinity)

- The 'cacheTime' is the duration that the inactive cache data remains in memory. Once this time passes, the cache data is removed from memory by the garbage collector.
- The default cacheTime is 5 minutes.

5. refetchOnMount (boolean | "always")

- The 'refetchOnMount' option executes refetch every time the data is mounted when in a stale state.
- The default value is 'true'.
- Setting it to 'always' will execute refetch every time the query is mounted.

6. refetchOnWindowFocus (boolean | "always")

- The 'refetchOnWindowFocus' option executes refetch every time the window is focused when the data is in a stale state.
- For example, it applies when you switch to another tab in Chrome and then return to the original tab you were viewing. Even if you open the developer tools with F12 and interact with the network or console tab, it applies if you click back inside the page.
- The default value is 'true'.
- Setting it to 'always' means that refetch will always be executed whenever the window is focused.
  Example code!

```javascript
// This is a query to fetch user information.
const { data: userInfo } = useQuery(
['user'],
getUser,
{
refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
staleTime: 60 \* 1000, // 1 minute
}
)
```

- If the refetch functions have all been turned off in the QueryClient defaultOptions settings, the refetch feature will not be executed. In that case, set the refetchOnWindowFocus option to 'true' to execute it.
- During the 1 minute in a fresh state, fetch requests will not be made no matter how many times you switch to different tabs.

7. refetchOnReconnect (boolean | "always")

- The 'refetchOnReconnect' option executes refetch when reconnected if the data is in a stale state.
- The default value is 'true'.
- 'always' will execute refetch whenever the query is reconnected, like the two options above.

8. onSuccess ((data: TDdata) => void)

- The 'onSuccess' function is executed upon a successful query.
- The 'data' parameter is the response value from the server upon success.

9. onError ((error: TError) => void)

- The 'onError' function is executed upon a failed query.
- It receives an error value as a parameter.

```javascript
const { data: userInfo } = useQuery(
['user'],
getUser,
{
refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
staleTime: 60 \* 1000, // 1 minute
onError: (error) => {
if (error.response?.data.code === 401) {
//...
}
},
}
)
```

10. onSettled ((data?: TData, error?: TError) => void)

- The 'onSettled' function is executed when a query settles upon receiving either successful data or an error.
- On success, the function receives the success data as a parameter, and on failure, it receives the error as a parameter.

11. initialData (TData | () => TData)

- If 'initialData' is set, it is used as the initial data for the query cache (when the query hasn't been created or cached yet).
- If the staleTime isn't set, the initial data is considered stale by default.

## Example code:

```javascript
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

// Define query function
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  return response.json();
}

function YourComponent() {
  // Use useQuery hook with query key and query function
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery("yourData", fetchData);

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item.value}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Summary:

React Query is a powerful data-fetching and state management library that makes it easy to fetch, cache, and manage server data in React applications. It provides useful hooks like useQuery to interact with data and handle various application states. By properly setting a QueryClientProvider and leveraging useQuery in your components, you can efficiently manage server state and improve overall application performance.
